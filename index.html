    <p>Ginger Root is an Indie band from California that really captures the 80s Aesthetic.</p>
    <p>Ironically, I came across one of their songs play at my workplace's music playlist. After looking them up on Youtube, I found their other songs and 
        instantly fell in love with their work.</p>
    <p class="city"> Some of my favorite songs from them are "Lonlieness", "Nominated" and "Entertainment"</p>
